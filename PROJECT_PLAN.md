# Project Plan: AEAMC 90-Day Sprint

This document outlines the 90-day plan to move the AEAMC project from a proof-of-concept to an investable business, based on the findings from the "Comprehensive Repository Analysis & Critical Examination".

## Phase 1: Complete the Core (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1: Finish the Coordinator

**File**: `coordinator/microblock_service.js`

- Implement proof verification, microblock formation, and Ethereum anchoring.

### Week 2: Complete Android Battery Monitoring

**File**: `sdk/android/app/src/main/java/com/example/aeamc/BatteryMonitor.kt`

- Implement real-world battery consumption metrics to validate energy savings claims.

### Week 3: Implement Real AI Workloads

**File**: `sdk/android/app/src/main/java/com/example/aeamc/RealWorkloadExecutor.kt`

- Replace simulated tasks with actual, resource-intensive AI workloads.

### Week 4: Ethereum Anchoring Smart Contract

**File**: `contracts/MicroblockAnchor.sol`

- Implement the smart contract for anchoring microblock digests to the Ethereum blockchain.

## Phase 2: Run the Pilot (Weeks 5-8)

### Week 5: Recruit 50 Devices

- Recruit 50 participants for the pilot test.

### Week 6-7: Collect Data

- Collect performance, energy, and reliability data from the 50 devices.

### Week 8: Analyze & Report

- Analyze the collected data and create a technical report.

## Phase 3: Competitive Differentiation (Weeks 9-12)

### Task: Benchmark Against Alternatives

- Benchmark AEAMC against competitors like BOINC, TensorFlow Federated, and AWS Lambda.
- Create a comparison matrix to highlight AEAMC's advantages.
